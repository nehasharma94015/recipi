1- Heat a pot/pan on medium heat. Once hot, add 1 tablespoon oil and then add the bay leaf, cinnamon, green cardamom, cloves and shahi jeera.

2- Let the spices sizzle for few seconds and then add the chopped garlic, ginger, green chili and onion.

Saute for around 2 minutes, do not brown the onion.

3- Then add the tomatoes along with cashews.

4- Add 2 cups water and stir.

5- Cover the pot with a lid and cook for around 10 to 12 minutes until tomatoes soften.

6- Let it cool down down a bit (around 15 minutes, if you blend it while it’s hot it might blow off from the blender), then discard the bay leaf and transfer mixture to a blender.

Blend to a smooth paste.

7- Use a strainer and strain the puree into another bowl. This makes sure the gravy is really smooth.

8- Put the same pan on medium heat again. Once hot, add 2 tablespoons unsalted butter and 1 teaspoon oil. Let the butter melt.

9- Add in the pureed gravy and cook for 2 minutes.

10- Then add the coriander powder, kashmiri red chili powder, salt, sugar and garam masala.

Let the curry cook for 2 to 3 minutes.

11- Add crushed kasuri methi and then cream.

12- Cook for additional 2 to 3 minutes on medium-low heat. Sprinkle some cardamom powder on top. The gravy is now done. Set aside and make kofta.

13- Boil the potatoes using a pressure cooker, 8-9 whistles on a stove-top pressure cooker. You can do this on the side while making the gravy.

Once the potatoes are boiled, let them cool a bit then peel and mash them.

14- To a large bowl, now add all ingredients for kofta- boiled and mashed potatoes, grated paneer, finely chopped ginger, cilantro, green chili, cashews, raisins, cornstarch, salt, white pepper powder and 1/4 teaspoon cardamom powder.

15- Mix everything together with your hands to form a dough.

16- Start making koftas from the dough. Take some part of the dough and roll between your palms to make it round.

17- Similarly makes all the koftas. I made 9 koftas, each around 40 to 42 grams.

18- Heat enough oil to fry in a kadai on medium-high heat. Make sure oil is hot, else koftas can stick to the pan and also disintegrate in the oil.

Drop koftas in hot oil.

19- Fry until golden brown from both sides. You can also shallow fry them, just press the koftas and flatten them like a burger tikki and shallow fry.

20- Remove the fried koftas on a paper towel.

To serve place koftas on plate and top with the gravy. Garnish with cream and cilantro. Or you can also place the gravy first on the serving plate, drizzle with cream and place koftas on top.

If you like melt in mouth soft koftas, it’s also a good idea to let the koftas simmer in the gravy for 2 minutes before serving.

If you prefer the koftas to be on the crispier side, then add gravy on top only before serving.

Enjoy malai kofta with naan or rice!
